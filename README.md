How the Code Works:
World Cities List:

I've added a predefined list of world cities such as New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Mumbai, Dubai, Berlin, Rome, and Los Angeles.
This list is passed to the OptionMenu widget, allowing the user to select one city from the drop-down.
Tkinter OptionMenu:

The OptionMenu widget displays the list of cities for the user to select from. When the user selects a city, that city name is assigned to the city_var variable.
Fetching Weather Data:

The get_weather() function uses the selected city to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
If the city is valid, the weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) is displayed in the labels.
Error Handling:

If the user doesn't select a city or if the API request fails, appropriate error messages are displayed using messagebox.
How to Use:
Replace the API Key: Don't forget to replace the YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
Running the App: Save the code in a Python file (e.g., weather_app.py), and run it:
bash
Copy code
python weather_app.py
Features:
Drop-down Menu: Users can select a city from a predefined list of popular cities.
Weather Information: Displays weather details like temperature, pressure, humidity, description, and wind speed for the selected city.
Error Handling: The app will notify users if they didn't select a city or if an error occurs (e.g., no internet connection or incorrect city).
Possible Enhancements:
Expand City List: You can add more cities or allow users to search for cities dynamically by integrating with a broader list or database of cities.
Icons for Weather: You can show weather icons based on the description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Multiple Days Forecast: Show a 5-day or 7-day forecast, which can be retrieved from the API.
Unit Conversion: Allow users to toggle between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units.
Conclusion:
This Python app provides a Weather Forecast with a simple, user-friendly GUI and allows users to select a city from a list of world cities. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and Tkinter for building the graphical interface. The app is easy to extend with more features and cities as needed.
